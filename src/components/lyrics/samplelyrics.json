(So cold) \n\nMaybe I'm just 2 demanding \n\nMaybe I'm just like my father - 2 bold \n\nMaybe U're just like my mother \n\nShe's never satisfied (She's never satisfied) \n\nWhy do we scream at each other? \n\nThis is what it sounds like when doves cry \n\n\n\nTouch if U will my stomach \n\nFeel how it trembles inside \n\nU've got the butterflies all tied up \n\nDon't make me chase U \n\nEven doves have pride \n\n\n\nHow could U just leave me standing \n\nAlone in a world so cold? (World so cold) \n\nMaybe I'm just 2 demanding \n\nMaybe I'm just like my father - 2 bold \n\nMaybe U're just like my mother \n\nShe's never satisfied (She's never satisfied) \n\nWhy do we scream at each other? \n\nThis is what it sounds like when doves cry \n\n\n\nHow can U just leave me standing \n\nAlone in a world that's so cold? (A world that's so cold) \n\nMaybe I'm just 2 demanding (Maybe, maybe I'm like my father) \n\nMaybe I'm just like my father - 2 bold (U know, U know he's 2 bold) \n\nMaybe U're just like my mother (Maybe U're just like my mother) \n\nShe's never satisfied (She's never, never satisfied) \n\nWhy do we scream at each other? (Why do we scream? Why?) \n\nThis is what it sounds like when doves cry \n\nWhen doves cry (When doves cry) (When doves cry) {x2} \n\nDon't cry (Don't cry) \n\n\n\nOh yeah {x6} \n\nWhen doves cry {x3} \n\nBabe! {x6} \n\n\n\nWhen doves cry (Doves cry, doves cry, doves cry) \n\nWhen?when? \n\nDon't cry \n\nDarling, don't cry \n\nDon't cry, don't cry, don't, don't cry"
